# game-of-sticks

Players take turns selecting a number of sticks from a pile. A player must pull between 1 and 3 sticks, decreasing the total in the pile. The object of the game is to make the opponent remove the last sticks from the pile.

Users enter a number to select an amount of sticks, from 10 to 100.

Users then select whether they would like to play a human opponent, or a computer opponent.

After making a selection, play alternates between the two participants (or one participant and computer). Each time prompted, the user must type 1, 2, or 3 to remove that number from the remaining stick total. Play continues in this fashion until there are no stick left to pick. The winner is the one that did not pull the last stick.
